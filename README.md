# Project Overview
This project is to build a convolutional neural network with Keras to classify dog breeds and then turn the code into a web app using Flask. Given an image of a dog, the model will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
