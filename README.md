# Project Overview
This project is to build a convolutional neural network with Keras to classify dog breeds and then turn the code into a web app using Flask. Given an image of a dog, the model will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
## Installing
Download the dog dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/dogImages.

Download the human dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/lfw. If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder.

Donwload the VGG-16 bottleneck features for the dog dataset. Place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features.
